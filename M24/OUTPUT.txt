What You Need to Know aboutEconomics to Be HappierByVíctor Saltero								1WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT ECONOMICS TO BEHAPPIERThere are two subjects that should be taught to the world’s children beforethey reach puberty. One is fluency of spoken expression, and the other iseconomics, as both will be pivotal to their development in their future lives.A high level of ability in language use opens a lot of doors because itfacilitates communication with others, allowing people to express theirthoughts, feelings and desires effectively. This in turn facilitates theintegration of young people into society; language unites us. I am sure that justabout everyone will agree with this idea.However, in the case of economics, no doubt there will be less consensus. Isuspect that many readers will have furrowed their brows, wondering whetherto continue reading, because they believe economics is a boring subject forspecialists that ordinary people will never understand.This impression is false. It is very easy to understand, and it is knowledgethat is extremely useful because your whole life, from cradle to grave—andeven afterwards—is affected by economics.For example, social stability, which is so essential to your wellbeing, is theproduct of a stable economy. When governments make bad decisions in thisarea—or in any other area connected with it, such as the financial sector—theycan end up ruining a whole country, although the consequences of their actsmay take years to materialize, dragging you along with the disaster, and muchof your happiness with it.An understanding of economics is essential because it will help us to makebetter personal decisions. This knowledge will enable us to take the rightapproach to buying a home or a car; it will give us the tools we need torecognize the approach of a recession, so that we can take measures tominimize its effects; it will help us to decide whether we should take out aloan; and it will be very useful when we want to start up a business. And itwill even allow us to work out whether the politicians we’re going to vote forare making feasible promises, or merely spouting populist nonsense thatwould end up dragging society down and the wellbeing of our family with it.A good knowledge of this subject gives us a clearer understanding of theworld we live in, as its principles are the same in every country; conversely,without such knowledge we will walk through life blindly, with a greater riskof stumbling and falling.Perhaps the first question that needs to be answered is: if economics is so								2important, why isn’t it taught at school? The answer is simple: becausenobody—our politicians least of all—has the slightest interest in ensuring thatyou know anything about this subject. They prefer to fill the curriculum withsubjects like history, which is manipulated in keeping with the interests of thegovernment of the day, or chemistry or math, which, beyond their basic rules,will generally not have the slightest relevance to our children’s lives, and othersubjects that make no attempt to transmit useful knowledge, but only conveythe appearance of knowledge.The political elite understand that a knowledge of economics would be athreat to their power. That is why they are not especially keen on lettingcitizens learn too much about it... not to mention the fact that they don’t knowmuch about it themselves because not even in the universities where thisscience is studied do they teach it effectively. What is generally taught is theparticular jargon used in each economic sector: the financial sector, theindustrial sector, the trade sector, etc. In short, the particular features andhistory of the different sectors, but no global understanding of the economy.Indeed, we tend to take for granted that somebody who understands thefinancial sector, for example, knows all about economics. This is a mistake.The only knowledge that this person would usually have of this subject is howto manage that part of the economy and the particular features of that specificsector, but not how it interrelates with the rest. Nevertheless, we tend toassume that they are experts in economics because we hear them use financialjargon that we don’t understand, although they probably don’t know anythingmore about economics than you do.And how did they manage to keep you and your children so indifferent tothis subject? By creating a halo of complexity around it that it doesn’t have—as will be shown below—and turning it into a boring and supposedly specialisttopic.Without further ado, let’s take a closer look at the subject.We’ll begin by defining exactly what economics is. Economics is simplythe science that studies every act of production and exchange of goods andservices to meet any kind of need or want that people may have.It has always been around. Cavemen offered any surplus goods they had toneighboring tribes in exchange for others they were short on. Such exchangeswere their way of trading, in an age before the invention of money when thisbartering process was the only means available to them. But it was a verylimited economic system, and would be quite useless today with more than sixbillion people on the planet.Money was invented more than 3,000 years ago, and since then economic								3concepts began evolving toward their current form.Let’s move forward to our times.In human nature there is a desire to possess things, which is born out of themost powerful of our instincts: the survival instinct. This is why we buy food,housing, clothing and all kinds of goods that become more numerous andvaried the more developed a society is, particularly as we move further beyondthe simple economics of survival. And it is precisely because of this instinct,which is imprinted in the human brain, that every political and economicphilosophy that eliminates or restricts private property inevitably ends upfailing. Such a philosophy goes against our nature.The phenomenon known as the economy comes into operation naturallywhenever somebody needs something he doesn’t have, because he will alwaysfind somebody else ready to provide it. And this is how the differentspecialized economic sectors come into being: production, transportation,storage, sales; and, if necessary, financing. Coexisting simultaneously withthese different agents is the State, which becomes an economic sector of itsown by taking a percentage of this movement of goods and services in theform of taxes.These sectors are all mutually interdependent, and collectively theyconstitute the economy.As noted above, the economy comes into operation when someone seeks agood or service, as this creates natural demand and that’s where it all begins.To facilitate understanding, I have outlined a simple formula that explainsand regulates all the rules governing the economy, and that can be applieduniversally.The formula is: Demand = production + trade = labor.And by extension: labor = more demand + more production + more trade =more labor.And so it goes on in an endless cycle.Conversely, the absence of natural demand—a term I will make use ofrepeatedly—has a negative impact on the other factors, resulting inunemployment and poverty.In short, when someone seeks something he wants (demand), somebodyelse will provide it by making it and selling it to him, having to createemployment to produce what he has been asked for. These new workers willalso need and want goods which, in turn, others will provide, for which theywill also have to create work to meet this demand, and so on. But if demand iscut, whatever the circumstances may be, unemployment and poverty will								4ensue.This is what this Formula means, and therein lie all the principles of theeconomy in a nutshell. The Formula also explains the reasons for the greatesteconomic successes, and likewise, the biggest economic disasters of all time.As will be shown below, these disasters are invariably the product oferroneous decisions by certain professional sectors involved in the economythat upset the harmonious balance of factors involved in the Formula.Normally, they are mistaken decisions made by governments or by thefinancial world, which are the two economic sectors with the biggest influenceon the economy, both for good and for ill.The best way to explain this is to consider some real-life cases, which Iwill offer below.The reason for the economic (and, therefore, social) failure of Africa is thatthere is no organized demand beyond what is necessary for mere survival; as aresult, there is minimal production, trade and labor.The failure of the USSR was caused by two main factors: the prohibitionor restriction of private property, leaving its citizens without any motivation towork; and the fact that the government decided what should be produced andpurchased—private companies were legally banned—and thus instead ofbeing governed by the natural demand of its citizens, the economy wasgoverned by the demand created and manipulated by the Soviet State, whichended up collapsing with a resounding crash because it was producing tanksand missiles in its factories when what the people wanted (natural demand)was bread, milk, clothes, and housing. In other words, production was notoperating in harmony with demand. So the Soviet state fell apart after causingits citizens a lot of suffering. Today North Korea is doing exactly the samething, and is headed in the same direction.The Chinese learned from the Soviet failure and at once took to applyingthe Formula described above, and with its effective implementation they haveturned their country into the world’s second biggest economic power.The secret of the economic success of the United States lies in the vitalityof its natural and organized demand, which created and maintains a largemiddle class, which is, in turn, what creates much of the demand on whichmany of us around the world live.As can be seen in these actual examples, in the negative cases the factorsof the Formula are upset by manipulation or absence of demand, while thepositive cases are the result of the effective application of that Formula.In Africa, if there is no organized and natural demand, they cannot create								5employment that would in turn generate further demand and moreemployment.In the former USSR, the State directed and manipulated demand bycontrolling industry, which only produced what the government instructed, notwhat the citizens wanted. As a logical consequence, none of the factors of theFormula could operate. In short, they were unable to get the economy running.The United States, and now also China, have the largest middle classes inthe world because they create a free yet organized and natural demand. Inother words, both countries apply the Formula effectively, although sometimesthey also make mistakes that end up affecting all of us.								6THE ECONOMY OF ABUNDANCE, OR THE END OF POVERTYThe new economic context created by the Industrial Revolution, and theabandonment of the gold standard as the benchmark for the production ofmoney, offers a number of possibilities that have yet to be fully developed,because economic leaders have failed to recognize all the opportunitiespresented by this new economic environment.One of the fundamental features of the current economic model, which Irefer to here as the “abundance model”, is that there are no limits on theproduction of wealth, which means that there should likewise be no limits onjob creation and, consequently, the elimination of poverty. Poverty has alwaysbeen and continues to be a product of what I call the “economy of scarcity”, asI will explain below.Until relatively recently (and in fact, in many parts of the world it is stillthe case), the economy was based on a notion of insufficiency. Gold, whichwas used as the monetary standard, tied the solvency and value of theeconomy to this insufficiency. And the same was true of farming and mining,which were the main sources of wealth until quite recently. As a consequenceof this economy based on limited resources, labor was obviously also limited.This economy of scarcity has been what has governed human history sincethe Stone Age. Indeed, the objective of most wars has been to seize theresources of another tribe or nation. This limited system of scarcity was alsobehind nearly all the economic crises of the past.The last great traumatic manifestation of this was the Wall Street Crash of1929, which precipitated the Great Depression. While the stock market crashwas really very important, what paralyzed the economy and led to a prolongedworldwide depression was the drying up of demand that resulted from the								7erroneous economic measures taken by the US government at the time.The US Federal Reserve itself helped to unleash the Great Depressionbecause it acted on the premise of scarcity after the stock market collapse byrestricting the flow of cash. This stifled the demand for goods because peopledidn’t have money to buy them, which in turn triggered a rise inunemployment. The price paid around the world for this mistake was huge,and it even had a big influence on the outbreak of World War II, since theincreased hardship it brought about paved the way for the rise to power of apopulist lunatic like Hitler.It is obvious that the political leaders and their advisors were acting inaccordance with the dictates of the economy of scarcity, and this is why itnever occurred to them that they should have done exactly the opposite ofwhat they did. In other words, instead of restricting cash, they should haveflooded the market with it, at low cost, in order to stimulate demand, which inturn would boost production and employment. But the reality was that theeconomic leaders never thought of such a possibility. The only solution theysaw was huge investments by the federal government, an approach that isnever effective because it increases taxes and public debt, and as a result, inthe medium term, leaves even less money in the hands of individuals andbusinesses, reducing demand and increasing unemployment even more. Eventoday some economists still praise the policy of big investments adopted bythe Roosevelt administration, crediting it with the end of the Great Depression.This is totally erroneous. The end of the crisis, as ghastly as it may seem, wasbrought about by the huge demand for all kinds of goods generated by WorldWar II, stimulating industry in the United States, which became the factory ofthe world.However, it was actually some time earlier that the first step was takentoward the end of the economic model of scarcity. This step was the success ofthe Industrial Revolution, although at the time nobody was aware of the fact. Itwas at this time that consumer goods began being mass produced, goods thatcould only be sold if there were a lot of people with purchasing power, whichmeant that more people needed ready money. But this first step did notdismantle the system of scarcity altogether, as in those days money continuedto be a limited resource. Nevertheless, it was a first step.For a while, this evolved system of industrial production coexisted with thetraditional monetary system, which was still stuck in the same old straitjacketof the gold standard for its production. As a result, goods were produced inhuge quantities, but the number of people with enough money to buy them didnot grow at the same rate.This of course resulted in severe tensions that economists could not								8foresee, much less explain or resolve effectively. It was also at this time thatpeople like Karl Marx would cause considerable damage to mankind withtheir theories, which were the product of sheer ignorance, as he completelyfailed to grasp what this new age meant and the possibilities that it opened upboth for employers and for workers. These misguided theories were adoptedby many people around the world (indeed, some still espouse them today),resulting in all kinds of suffering and social ills, including the Cold War.It would thus not be until quite late in the last century (1971) that the neweconomy would finally be born, as the product of the definitive elimination ofgold as the monetary standard in each country.From that time on, the standard used would be the country’s grossdomestic product (GDP) and a series of other variables such as workingcapital needs, inflation, etc. The brilliance of this new system is that there areno longer any limits on the production of money than the ingenuity of acountry’s citizens to create wealth.As a result, once the two elements of the Industrial Revolution and theelimination of the gold standard were combined, the current economic model,the economy of abundance, was born.However, we have moved from the old economic model of scarcity to thenew model of abundance almost without realizing it. This is why thepossibilities and dimensions of the new model have yet to be fully understoodand exploited by our economic leaders and governments. This lack ofunderstanding has given rise to the poverty and economic crises that sofrequently afflict us, including the crisis of 2008.As mentioned above, the key to the successful operation of this economicmodel lies in the vitality of our society to create a demand for goods andservices in a natural and organized way, as this is what creates the employmentneeded to meet that demand, which in turn gives rise to more natural demand,and so on. This cycle is what should soon bring an end to miserliness, andshortly thereafter to poverty.However, it is important to note that the economy of abundance is beingimplemented around the world in a highly irregular manner. In Africa, forexample, there is no sign of it, as the economy of scarcity continues to prevail.Its economy is very primitive, tribal and disorganized. In most Latin Americancountries, the implications of the new scenario have not been properly graspedeither, as they have only just begun learning how to implement it. Many othercountries, such as India or Russia, have yet to develop it very effectively. In allthese cases, the new model will be implemented actively when their leadershave a proper understanding of it, as only then will they recognize thepossibilities it offers their citizens and the governments themselves, which will								9be able to collect more money as the GDP rises, without having to raise taxes.In Western Europe, this economic model of abundance is being fullyapplied, although the activity of their bloated, interventionist governmentsundermines its effects, resulting in chronically high unemployment levels onthe Old Continent. By keeping taxes excessively high, governments aresiphoning money out of the market and reducing the purchasing power of theircitizens, resulting in a reduction in demand as well. This in turn increasesunemployment.In China, the new model is being implemented effectively, with thepeculiarity that a single party holds all political power. This ensures a verypositive level of stability today, but promises upheavals in the future when thenew generations of the bourgeoisie and middle class demand a share of thatpower. We must hope that intelligence prevails and the transition is smoothand balanced.In the United States, this economic model has been fully implemented, andas government intervention is limited the country doesn’t suffer from theunemployment problems that afflict Europe.The United States, which is the country with the biggest share of the globaleconomy, is a special case because its population is made up of a mixture ofraces and cultures whose interbreeding enriches the country, resulting in adynamic and creative society that is the product of natural selection, due to thefact that many of the most energetic individuals from other countries haveimmigrated to this country.These characteristics, along with its principle of freedom, facilitate wildlyimaginative initiatives resulting in the creation of profuse and widespreadwealth that translates into millions of jobs and a strong middle class. But thiscreative imagination when applied to the financial sector has at times led toexcesses, with some peculiar outcomes that pose significant risks. Thus, theoccasional economic problems suffered in this country tend to be the productof misguided actions on the part of its financial sector, which also affect therest of the world.It is undeniable that the financial sector is extremely useful to societybecause it serves as a channel for the flow of cash, but it is for this very reasonthat turmoil in this sector, with its decisive influence on the economy as awhole, can sometimes have catastrophic consequences. This is why it shouldbe a key role of governments especially to regulate and control this sector inorder to prevent the damaging effects of any excesses, as occurred in 2008.The United States should lead the way in this regulation, which couldbegin by re-establishing clearly defined boundaries between commercial and								10investment banking.Commercial banks should continue to have the backing of the centralbanks (as they have always done) to guarantee deposits and provide them withliquid assets when necessary. This banking sector should provide the marketwith secured loans, taking care that such loans never exceed the value (oruseful life) of the asset for which the loan is granted. The sector should beprohibited from participating in high-risk transactions, such as the purchase of“derivatives”, as these are generally nothing more than a mix of differentfinancial products with different degrees of vulnerability, which are boughtand sold frenetically with big risks, because buyers almost never know what itreally is they are buying. No such transactions should be on the books ofcommercial banks because they pose a danger to the reliability of the system.The profits of these institutions will of course always be moderate, but as theydo not participate in high-risk transactions they will be very stable.In the case of investment banks or similar institutions, what is mosturgently needed is for users and customers to be clearly aware (and this shouldalso be the job of the governments) that unlike commercial banks they are notprotected by the central bank, and that although with imagination and luckinvestors may earn large sums of money with such banks, they must also beaware that they could lose everything, because neither taxpayers’ money northe commercial banks (which should not be involved in the investment sector)will come to their rescue if difficulties arise.It is also important to learn from recent history and to correct mistakeswhere necessary, because crises like the one in 2008 have demonstrated thatthe risk insurance that banks purchased through insurers was a mere fiction.This operates as follows: the financial institution makes a purchase, forexample, of a large package of mortgages from another institution. It theninsures against potential losses or defaults through an insurance company, andthereby theoretically eliminates the risk from its balance sheets, allowing it toseek new loans secured by the insurance and continue investing. This in realityis no more than an accounting sleight of hand that conceals the danger; the riskis still there, because when the borrowers default, the insurers are unable tocover their debts as the costs are too great. The defaults thus end up affectingthe financial institution, which suddenly has losses on its books, and this inturn causes panic among its creditors and depositors, who perceive a threat tothe savings they have invested with the company and rush in a stampede to tryto withdraw as much as they can.The social role of financial institutions and the banking sector is to channelcredit and savings in a stable and efficient manner. But to be able to apply theeconomy of abundance with all its potential for development, these dangersposed by the financial sector outlined here need to be corrected as quickly as								11possible in the interests of protecting us from future global crises.Another area for improvement relates to a lack of global homogeneity.Currently, each country applies its own criteria to the accounting controlsystems of major companies listed on the stock exchange. The globalizedcontext in which money moves around makes it advisable for themeasurement and control methods used by these companies to be the sameeverywhere, but this is not happening. This abnormality poses additional risks,as I will explain below. In the US accounting system, the financial assets ofAmerican companies have to be updated regularly, to reflect increases anddecreases on their books that translate into profits and losses.In Europe, most countries do not operate this way. The companies listed onthe stock market only adjust the value of their assets on their books when theyunload them. Thus, when difficulties are foreseen due to a drop in value ofsuch assets on the market, the company’s directors will determine not to sellthem in order to avoid the appearance of losses on their balance sheets.Clearly, the US accounting system is more transparent, but the Europeansystem is more secure in that it prevents major shocks, as its accountingmethod keeps companies from having to speak of losses (which always has apotential for causing panic among investors), resorting instead to euphemismslike “cash shortage”, “liquidity problems”, etc.In any case, a consensus should be reached on one or the other method bythe governments of the world’s major economies, adopting a single globalaccounting system for any company listed on the stock exchange, especiallythose operating in the financial sector. The economic authorities of everynation need to acknowledge once and for all that the financial sector isglobalized, and therefore needs global rules to minimize risks.Another worthwhile step would be to return the stock market to its originalrole of financing new projects and maintaining existing ones, and reducing thepredominance of “short-termists”, who sometimes take big risks (and obtainbig profits) that can even push companies into bankruptcy. This should beregulated and controlled by agreements between governments and thefinancial sector, in order to prevent these highly destabilizing practices of thevirtual economy.There are many other steps to take, but one of the most important forpreventing future risks is to introduce instruction in the basics of economics inschools so that young people have a better understanding of this subject, as itwill affect them their whole lives much more than other subjects they arestudying.In conclusion, we are living in an exciting age, the age of the economy of								12abundance, and if we are able to predict and prevent the risks it poses, we mayfind ourselves in the first era of human history in which poverty is no longeran insoluble problem, as it can be solved with the possibilities that thiseconomic model offers for the creation of hundreds of millions of jobs aroundthe world, once all nations learn how to apply it and abandon the practices andmentalities, still prevailing in many places, of the economy of scarcity.FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT ECONOMICSBelow is a list of the questions I have been asked most often in recenttimes on this subject, although I have already answered some of them in otherwritten works.What caused the global financial crisis of 2008?At the end of the last century there were two basic types of institutions inthe financial sector: traditional banks and investment banks. Both are tomoney what a riverbed is to water. If you make changes to the riverbed thataren’t well planned, you may cause the river to dry up or, conversely, tooverflow. In the case of this crisis, poor decisions resulted in an initialoverflow of money that led to a subsequent monetary drought. These decisionsdried up credit, which in turn dried up demand.Why did this happen? The role of traditional banks was to act as adepository of the people’s money and, with a profit margin from interest, toloan it to anyone who needed it with the due guarantees, since it was otherpeople’s money they were lending. The central banks of each countrysupposedly supervised these banks to ensure they didn’t do anythingoutlandish that would put the money of their depositors at risk.Meanwhile, investment banks sought capital from others and invested it inhigh-risk transactions, with the aim of increasing profits for their clients, andfor themselves, if these transactions proved successful. These banks were,along with pension funds, the big investors in stock markets around the world.Then, at the end of the 1990s, US President Clinton lifted the restrictionson traditional banks related to stock market investment, while allowing otherfinancial institutions to act as traditional banks as well. Many other countriesimitated this initiative.The result was a massive injection of money into stock markets around theworld, thereby creating artificial demand. Thus began a problem whoseconsequences would be felt years later.								13At the beginning of this century, banks and financial institutions begangranting huge loan packages, mostly for housing but also to purchase othergoods. They gave out more loans than businesses and the public needed fortheir usual demand, and these loans encouraged people to spend beyond thereal possibilities of return.The financial sector was delighted because, on paper, it was making a lotof money. With these theoretical profits it distributed generous dividends to itsstakeholders. As will be shown below, these lavish profits led to huge losses,which we all ended up having to pay for.The lending institutions had already granted loans to people who were ableto pay it back, so they began lowering the requirements in order to provideloans to less solvent borrowers.The borrowers receiving this money assumed that the experts knew whatthey were doing, and thought: If the banks are prepared to give me money, itmust be because I can afford it. So they bought bigger houses or new cars theyneither needed nor were really able to pay for.The banks and financial institutions knew that these were high-riskmortgages and lending operations. And so to control this risk, they took outdefault insurance with various insurers (especially with the company AIG). Ifsomeone defaulted on a mortgage or a loan, these insurers would have to coverthe cost. In this way, the banks wrote off their risks and were able to seek newloans to continue operating, and as a result they went further and further intodebt. The insurers assumed this risk on a global scale, convinced that thehousing market would continue to boom.But this conviction was far from logical. Having inflated demand with somuch credit, housing prices ended up falling due to a supply surplus becausetoo much housing had been built; more than what people needed. Mortgageswere foreclosed and the insurers had to pay for the defaults. All of them, allover the world, and at the same time. They couldn’t pay. So the banks tookmassive losses all on the same day, because responsibility for the defaultsultimately fell to them, and as a result they went under and took the financialsystem with them.These were the reasons for the financial crisis that began in 2008, theconsequences of which are still being felt today in many countries.As you can see, it was a flagrant violation of the Formula outlined above,as it created fictitious (and therefore not natural) demand, as a result of theexcessive credit. This produced a bubble that came close to bringing down theglobal economy.Financial institutions, with the support of governments, were the ones that								14created this disaster, because while credit has the capacity to build a moderneconomy, a lack of credit has the power to destroy it swiftly and completely,which is what inevitably happens when people are unable to get loans to buy ahouse, start a business, fill store shelves, or buy a car. In short, without credit,demand dries up and this undermines the other factors of the Formula:production, trade and labor. And the excessive credit initially gives rise toexcessive consumption, which inevitably leads to a monetary drought.The banks were left in a disastrous state of insolvency, with massive debts,and ceased to fulfill their social role, which is to be the channel for the flow ofcash; they held up the circulation of money while they licked their wounds.They pushed the world to the brink of collapse, as all this happened veryfast. The situation stabilized very slowly, through huge injections of moneytaken from public taxes into banks around the world. But we must not forgetthat this crisis could happen again unless governments and central banksimpose sufficient controls on financial institutions.In short, as can be seen, the key to this crisis was a severe manipulation ofdemand, which was no longer natural.What is money?It is one of man’s most brilliant creations, because without it we wouldnever be able to feed the billions of inhabitants of the world today.First of all, it is worth clarifying that money is nothing more than a simpleconvention. Its solidity depends on the confidence that its holder needs to havethat he will be able to exchange this piece of metal or paper in his hands forgoods in the country that issued that currency.Money was born out of a need for individuals and societies to have aneffective instrument for exchanging goods.In the most ancient times, in societies much simpler than ours, thesetransactions were limited to the mere exchange of merchandise betweenindividuals. Thus, for example, a man in possession of a wheat surplus wouldseek to exchange it for animal hides for clothing from a man who producedmore than he needed. Probably this was how the art of haggling was born, anart still practiced in many parts of the world, because it must have beendifficult to determine, for example, how much wheat should be given inexchange for a sheepskin. It would be reasonable to assume that thesetransactions would have been sealed after long nights of discussions that nodoubt would have been enjoyable in themselves.Things started to get complicated when, as a consequence of demographicgrowth and production specialization, it became harder to make significant								15trading deals and compare prices and values, which represented an obviousobstacle to large-scale trade. This problem was resolved with the ingeniousinvention of what we know today as money. Once it appeared, trade expandedquickly, since it facilitated the exchange of goods both between individualsand between communities.In the beginning, in the absence of a monetary system, trade wasconducted using chickens, cows or pigs as units of reference. In fact, the firstRoman coins minted bore images of these animals and received the name of"pecunia", a term derived from "pecus", which in Latin means "livestock".But what is money, really? As I mentioned above, it is a convention, anunwritten agreement, as physically it is generally just a piece of metal or paperof barely any value in itself.Without attempting to offer an analysis of its evolution throughout history,I will point out a few important points that will hopefully shed some light onwhat it is.Until a short time ago, all the money placed in circulation in a countrycorresponded to the total value of the gold reserves held in the national bank.This was what is known as the economy of scarcity. This system lasted fromancient times right up to our days. Money was thus a kind of check to bearer,payable immediately, issued by the State, which the holder expects to be ableto exchange in gold or equivalent goods at the value specified. For example, ifthe Bank of France had 100 tons of gold in its coffers, it would produce andcirculate coins and bills equal to that total value; its division into smaller unitsgave rise to what has come to be known as national currency, to which eachcountry gave its own name. This meant that the value of any currency incirculation was guaranteed by the equivalent proportion of gold deposited inthe State Bank. In some cases, the coins were even produced directly in goldor silver, and thereby acquired value in themselves.This system—the gold standard—fell into disuse once and for all late inthe last century (in 1971) as a consequence of the deflationary crisis of 1929.It was replaced by a complex system directed mainly by the central banks ofeach country, with varying degrees of independence from their respectivegovernments, in which various factors are taken into account to determine theamount of money that should be placed in circulation: Gross domestic product(GDP), the currency needs of companies, individuals and States, balances ofpayments, inflation, etc.This new system has resulted in what is called the economy of abundancebecause its implementation makes it possible to increase the number of peoplewith a reasonable standard of living continuously, as there are no limits on theproduction of money other than the imagination and hard work of individuals								16to create wealth.What is the stock market?The stock market began as a source of financing for companies, in additionto or instead of traditional loans. Over time, it has turned into a mechanism forfacilitating public access to companies, as it allows any citizen to purchase ashare in them for a little money.Companies that need a capital injection to be able to take on new projectsor to stabilize the ones they are developing have the opportunity to obtain itfrom individuals or entities who entrust their savings to them and who, bydoing so, become shareholders.The main advantage of companies listed on the stock exchange is, inaddition to obtaining financing, they don't pay interest for the money theyreceive, as they would have to in the case of loans. The shareholder orinvestor, meanwhile, becomes a co-owner of the company, and is thereforesubject to its financial fate. In other words, if the company in which he hasbought shares earns profits, part of those profits will go to him, always inaccordance with the percentage of his share. On the other hand, if thecompany takes losses, the shareholder could end up losing all the capital heinvested in itAs noted above, this source of financing has played a key role in thegrowth of companies in recent decades and has made their ownership public,because there are millions of small investors around the world who use theirsavings to buy shares on the stock market. These investments are known asrisk capital, because if the company takes a loss, its shares drop in value andpart of their savings may be lost; but if it earns profits, the investor can have ashare in them and his share value may increase.However, shares have a subjective value, which takes on increasingimportance every day thanks to supply and demand. If there is a lot of demandfor certain shares—more potential buyers than sellers—their price will rise; inmost cases, this is due more to the herd mentality of buyers than the incomestatements of the companies concerned. Conversely, shares fall when thenumber of buyers—or the amount of buyer money—is lower than the offer ofshares made at a particular price.This behavior has made speculative transactions so significant in recentyears that shares in companies facing an unstable financial situation can endup being overvalued while others in a healthy condition can be undervalued.Consequently, with the passage of time, the stock market has lost itsusefulness as a gage of the state of health of a country's economy.The problem lies in the fact that the means have been confused with the								17ends. The original purpose of the stock market as a source of financing forbusiness projects has been obscured by the mere speculative game of chasing aquick profit. These days, hardly anybody trusts their savings to the sameshares for any length of time to reap a company's profits when its projects aresuccessful. In the current reality, investors on the stock market buy and sellshares compulsively, looking for a quick profit from the speculative rise or fallof the shares they are trading. In other words, the stock market has basicallyturned into something like a virtual business which, in most cases, does notgenerate any collective wealth at all.It would be interesting to consider returning the stock market to its roots,especially after the globalization of finance, since this has meant thatspeculative transactions in New York, for example, influence and endanger thesavings of millions of investors around the world who have neither theinformation nor the training necessary to have any control over what theyinvest.What should the role of the State be in the economy?The role of the State in a modern economy should be as a regulator of theeconomic sectors that participate in it, creating laws that are sensible andagreed on with the sectors concerned. It should also perform two otheressential roles: as an arbitrator in the resolution of any conflicts that may arise,and as a careful monitor of strict compliance with the rules by the differenteconomic sectors, especially the financial sector, in view of its huge influence.But what the State should never be—except in very limited strategic casesof obvious public interest—is an entrepreneur, as it doesn’t know how to do it.Every time a State has turned into an entrepreneur, in the medium term it hasended up plunging the citizens of its country into poverty.Moreover, it is important to understand that the State does not createwealth or employment. When a government hires officials it isn’t creatingemployment; it is creating expenditure. The reason that this is so—returning tothe Formula—is because most government officials perform activities thathave not arisen from any natural demand of the public, but from a decision bythe politicians in power at that moment. In other words, they are notproducing anything that has been requested or demanded by the community.It is undeniable that for the State to be able to provide the services forwhich it exists (security, public works, justice, etc.), it has to collect taxes fromthe citizens and employ officials to carry out these obligations. But it shoulddo so with the utmost prudence, because an increase in government officialshas the inevitable consequence of increasing sterile bureaucratic costs, andwith it the obligation of increasing taxes, which leads to a reduction in demandbecause there is less money available to citizens and, as a result, there would								18be a foreseeable increase in unemployment in the medium term.However, according to current political mentalities, it is unacceptable thatone part of society should have to live in poverty, which is why today’sgovernments, when spending the money received from their citizens in theform of taxes, have to provide funds to help the weakest members of society.But they should also manage this money very prudently, because if the numberof aid recipients increases, the government will have to increase costs tosupport them (and to keep their votes in the process), and this can only bedone by either increasing taxes or going into debt, which will create morepoverty, leading into a perverse economic circle that can only end bybankrupting us all. Governments must ensure that the burden of the subsidizedclasses does not impoverish the active workforce, who are the ones who keepthe country going.The best way that governments can really help society’s weakest membersis by contributing to the creation of employment, and the best way they can dothis is by removing barriers to business creation and encouragingentrepreneurs. This can be achieved by providing social stability, rules of playthat are sensible and generally agreed on, and legal certainty.Is consumerism negative?There is a highly significant anecdote that is in a way related to thisquestion. Mario Soares (the leader of the Socialist Party in Portugal) had justwon the elections in his country when he received a congratulatory phone callfrom his Swedish counterpart, Olof Palme (also a socialist).In this conversation, Soares said to Palme: “In two years I will have gottenrid of all the rich people in Portugal.” To which the Swede replied: “I don’twant to get rid of the rich, my plan is to get rid of the poor.”Of course, Palme was right. The problem is not that there are rich people,but that there are poor people. The fact that many people spend huge sums ofmoney on eccentric consumer products is not negative, if they can afford it.Why does anyone need a Ferrari, a hundred pairs of shoes, or a privateairplane? The obvious answer is nobody, as they are not a vital necessity,offering nothing more than the vain pleasure of being able to show them off.But in buying such goods these rich people have paid taxes and createdemployment. In reality, they have generated demand for something worth a lotof money, which then turns into labor.On the opposite extreme—and socially much more favorably viewed thanthe above example—is the citizen who has only two suits: one to wear and theother to wash, and brags about not needing more. Such stoicism isintellectually satisfying, but unfortunately it contributes nothing to society, and								19does not help create work for others.But that being said, it is worth clarifying the following: Consumption isnegative—and in this case it is appropriate to use the pejorative term“consumerism” for it—when it is financed by loans that cannot be paid back,or with maturity periods that are longer than the average useful life of theproduct financed. Such behavior can certainly be classified using thepejorative sense of the term. When this happens—for example, financing thepurchase of a car over twenty years, longer than the useful life of the vehicle—all we are doing is creating excess demand today, and inflation with it, inexchange for a lack of demand tomorrow due to saturation of the market, andthen we will be brewing an employment crisis for the future.In economics, is there truth in the perception that if someone has a lot,someone else must go without?This widespread assumption arose by default as a result of the type ofeconomy that predominated throughout human history until relatively recently.This economy was based on mining operations, with gold as the monetarystandard: all of them goods in short supply. It therefore seemed obvious that ifsome had a lot, others must have to go without.But the Industrial Revolution, and then in the last century the abandonmentof the gold standard, brought an end to the economic system of scarcity, givingway to the current system based on an economy of abundance, which renderedthis assumption erroneous.In the modern economy, as noted above, there are no limits on the creationof wealth other than the imagination and effort that people are prepared toexert within a regulated system, in accordance with the terms of the Formuladescribed above. This means that we all could have “a lot”, regardless of howmuch others possess.The economy of today has completely changed the obsolete principles ofscarcity, with its notion that “if someone has a lot someone else must dowithout”, although many politicians still successfully exploit this propagandaas a populist weapon in order to win power.Today, the money placed in circulation in a country is related to the GDPof that country, which means that the only limit is the capacity of thatcountry’s citizens to create wealth. This means that the more goods producedby a country that the markets want to buy, the more the GDP will rise, andwith it the money in circulation and the incomes of all its citizens.Why is Venezuela, in spite of all the oil it has, in such a terrible economicstate?								20Indeed, this beautiful country has been plunged into an intense drama, inwhich poverty has taken over the daily lives of its people.I will offer a quick overview of its recent history so that the origins ofthese serious problems may be better understood.In the last century, Venezuela had a theoretically democratic two-partysystem for decades, characterized more than anything by corruption. Lusinchi,Caldera, Pérez and other leaders drove the country to bankruptcy, and this ledto social upheaval. Out of this upheaval emerged Hugo Chávez, a man with amilitary background, who came to power promising to clean things up andbring an end to the chaos.But he didn’t know how to do it, nor has his successor, Maduro. Bothleaders governed in ignorance, just as those before them had governed incorruption. It was out of such ignorance that they nationalized the country’smost important companies, and they have simply had no idea how to managethem efficiently. The result of this has been even more poverty than there wasin the days of the corrupt rulers. This has only meant more suffering for theVenezuelan people, because demagogic slogans and incendiary speeches likethose of the current government, blaming everyone else for its ills, will notsolve anything at all.From an economic standpoint, it is worth noting that Venezuela has one ofthe largest oil reserves in the world, as well as other important naturalreserves, which, if managed effectively, would be able to lift its people out ofthe situation they currently find themselves in.To do this they will need to find competent rulers who can apply theformula outlined above with integrity and diligence, beginning by restoringcivil peace.If they can achieve this, a great future lies ahead for them.How would secession from Spain affect the people of Catalonia?While sailing on the Mediterranean recently, we saw a group of dolphinsswimming harmoniously near our boat. It was a beautiful sight. With us was amarine biologist, who explained that they were pilot whale dolphins, and thatthey possessed some curious characteristics. One of these was that they alwaysfollowed a leader, and when that leader became ill or lost its sense ofdirection, it would swim for the shore where it would beach and, inevitably,die. What is curious is that the other dolphins would follow it to the end anddie beached on the shore with their leader.The Catalan situation reminds me of these dolphins. A few political leadersare leading Catalonia to the shore, and a segment of the Catalan people are								21following them, just like the dolphins following their disorientated leader.Catalonia has been politically structured as a part of Spain practically sinceits origins, and it has a strong middle class with a very reasonable standard ofliving. Nevertheless, some of its political leaders want to drag it toward thecreation of an independent state, and some of its citizens are following them.If this secession were to take place, they would be creating a new,independent country, and under existing laws that country would not be part ofthe European Union, and would obviously be out of the eurozone. They wouldhave to create their own currency, which would have no value outsideCatalonia. This is irrefutable, however much ignorant flag-waving fanaticsmay wish to deny it.But continuing with the secessionist hypothesis, it is easy to foresee that asthe date of secession drew near, Catalan banks would not have a single euro ordollar left in their coffers, because nearly everybody would start withdrawingthem when they rightly guessed that the new government would convert themall by decree into Catalan currency, which, beyond their borders, would beworth no more than Monopoly money.Obviously, the citizens would receive their salaries in this new currency,but they would have to pay for all kinds of imported goods in dollars or euros,which they would have to buy at exorbitant prices, and this would result in asudden spike in the costs of all imported products and, inevitably, runawayprice increases in normal consumer goods, dragging the purchasing power ofthe new nation’s citizens down, and increasing poverty at the same rate.On the other hand, market needs would require any company of areasonable size based in Catalonia to leave the country just to survive, and thiswould drive all its subsidiary companies, employees, etc., to bankruptcy.These are not opinions. They are no less than the precise application ofbasic economic principles, combined with international law. Theseconsequences are inevitable, and once again we can see the need for people toreceive an economic education, as it would enable them to understand theformidable dangers they are taking on.And what about you? Doesn’t this direction being taken by the Catalanpeople remind you of the pilot whale dolphins?Víctor Saltero								22
